Ted Landa used GVR SDK version 1.0.3 for this project. 


What I liked most about this particular project was that I got a lot of exposure to scripting and programming which is very beneficial to where I want to go in my VR Development career. The Maze was my first real game development and I enjoyed creating something other people can play. 

The challenging part about this project was synchronizing the scripts of the door, key and coin to make sure they work together in a similar fashion. It was difficult to understand the coding aspect of building a maze.
