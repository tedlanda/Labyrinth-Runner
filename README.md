# Labyrinth Runner

**Introdution**

Created a game where a player navigates around a maze collecting coins and attempts to find a key to unlock the door to get to the finish line. As the scene starts up, a user finds themselves surrounded by yellow walls and green cubes serving as navigational points. The user is to hit the cardboard button which taps the screen using a crosshair and then teleports there. The goal is to find a key to arrive at a door than opens up to the finish line. The user cannot open the door unless they collect the key first which, by the way, is tucked in a secret area of the maze. 

__Development Process__

Some C# scripting was used in order to make the key's particles fly in Unity as well as `object.instantiante` for my door game object. It was necessary to create small cube-like game objects and scale all the walls to proper size. I had gathered my maze ideas from mazes I used to do on paper as a kid in elementary school. If I could go start to finish at first glance, I knew that would not be a good layout for my labyrinth. A lot of creativity went into the maze. I tried making sure that my pillars didn't go under the plane of my designated space and that the walls were rotated so that the picture was seamless. 

**User Testing**

I noticed that children were able to find the key much faster than adults. It took my 10 year old niece less than 5 minutes to find the key and she was able to get to the door, unlock it, and cross the finish line. My 50 year old co-worker took forever to find the key but only did so once I showed him where it was located. It was tucked in the middle of the maze which is why he had been going in circles.

__Breakdown of final piece__

**Conclusion**

The scripting aspect was the hardest part to making a well working maze. It was easy to make the particles fly out of catching the key but actually putting it in your pocket and using it (virtually) to unlock the door took a few lines of code editing. It was easy to make the door fly up but having to make it stay at the level I needed it to was some work in progress.
