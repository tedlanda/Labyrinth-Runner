# Labyrinth Runner

**Introdution**

Created a game where a player navigates around a maze collecting coins and attempts to find a key to unlock the door to get to the finish line. As the scene starts up, a user finds themselves surrounded by yellow walls and green cubes serving as navigational points. The user is to hit the cardboard button which taps the screen using a crosshair and then teleports there. The goal is to find a key to arrive at a door than opens up to the finish line. The user cannot open the door unless they collect the key first which, by the way, is tucked in a secret area of the maze.
